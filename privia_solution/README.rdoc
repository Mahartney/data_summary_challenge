This is Davis Green's submission to the Privia Health - Coding Challenge. Having not been able to begin the challenge until 5/4, I was very conscious of turning around the challenge as quickly as possible. To do so, I made use of Rails scaffolding, something I generally would not do. For that reason that are many superfluous files and code snippets. I have attempted to remove any presence of these from that actual interface of the app.

That being said, I am fairly comfortable with my submission. On the root page the user is invited to both add a new import and view a list of previous imports. Each import can then been viewed by its constituent line items. You'll see I did decide to break down the domain of the problem in to two models: the import and the line item. I thought this was the best way to approach the problem in any kind of scalable way. I can imagine a scenario where the user would want access to the line items as a whole, regardless of the import it was included on, but then also wanting to be able to increase apparatus of the import itself(adding a name or description perhaps -- something I intended on doing with more time).
